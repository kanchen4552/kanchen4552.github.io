Kan Chen is a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Biostatistics Department of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health](https://hsph.harvard.edu/department/biostatistics/) mentored by [Prof. Xihong Lin](https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/lin-lab/). 

Kan Chenâ€™s research focuses on developing robust and interpretable statistical methods for causal inference in observational studies, especially in the presence of unmeasured confounding, high-dimensional covariates, and complex data structures. His work includes methodological contributions to sensitivity analysis, partial identification, and bias reduction. Motivated by applications in oncology, public health, and biomedical research, his goal is to create statistically rigorous methods that are directly applicable to real-world challenges in health and social science domains.




How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
