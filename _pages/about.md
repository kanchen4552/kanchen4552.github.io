Kan Chen is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Biostatistics Department of Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health mentored by [Prof. Xihong Lin](https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/lin-lab/). 

Kan Chenâ€™s research focuses on developing robust and interpretable statistical methods for causal inference in observational studies, particularly in the presence of unmeasured confounding, high-dimensional covariates, and complex data structures. His work integrates machine learning techniques with statistical methodology for sensitivity analysis, partial identification, and bias adjustment. Motivated by applications in oncology, public health, and biomedical research, his goal is to develop statistically rigorous and computationally scalable methods for analyzing large and complex observational data.

Kan Chen recieved his PhD in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science from University of Pennsylvainia, mentored by [Prof. Dylan Small](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dsmall/) and [Prof. Qi Long](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8939931).
