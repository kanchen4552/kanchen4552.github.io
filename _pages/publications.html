<h3>Causal Inference</h3>
<p>
  This body of work advances statistical methodologies for causal inference using observational data, with a focus on 
  <strong>partial identification</strong>, <strong>sensitivity analysis</strong>, <strong>mediation analysis</strong>, and <strong>case-control designs</strong> 
  to address challenges such as <strong>unmeasured confounding bias</strong>, <strong>selection bias</strong>, and 
  <strong>residual bias</strong>. These methods are applied to real-world problems in 
  <strong>social policy</strong>, <strong>clinical research</strong>, and <strong>oncology studies</strong>.

<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>
This research develops and applies machine learning methods for causal inference and treatment effect estimation, including <strong>interpretable deep learning models</strong>, <strong>privacy-preserving algorithms</strong>, and <strong>large-scale emulated trials</strong>. It spans a broad range of topics, from <strong>federated instrumental variable estimation</strong> for distributed healthcare data to <strong>optimization theory for overparameterized neural networks</strong>, with the goal of integrating modern machine learning tools into rigorous and scalable causal analysis frameworks.
